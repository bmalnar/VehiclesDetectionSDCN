# VehiclesDetectionSDCN
Vehicles detection using HOG and SVM for Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree

### Overview
The repository contains the jupyter notebook implementing the pipeline for detecting vehicles on the road using the pictures and videos provided. The images and videos are taken by a front-facing camera mounted on the car and driving on the highway. The pipeline uses HOG features and the SVM classifier to perform detections. 

An example picture is shown below.

### Files and directories content
- `vehicle_detection_pipeline.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook containing all of the code and the description of each individual steps.  
- The directory `test_images` contains images used for testing the pipeline 
- The video `project_video.mp4` is the input video for the project that needs to be processed by the pipeline. 
- The video file `project_video_out.mp4` contain the output video generated by the pipeline. The video is the same as the input video `project_video.mp4`, but with the vehicle detections drawn on top of the video frames. 
- `writeup.md` describes the pipeline from the higher level and discusses the results. 

### How to run the code
To run the code, simply clone the repository, and run the command `jupyter notebook` from the directory containin the notebook _vehicle_detection_pipeline.ipynb_. All of the input data is provided. 

The code has been tested using:
- Python 3.6.3 under Anaconda3 and Windows 8.1
- OpenCV 3.3.1

### Known limitations and issues

- The pipeline does not produce perfect results on the video, and the detected lane lines are wiggle a bit. This can be further improved by changing the pipeline to be more robust for different ligthing conditions and in the areas with shadows.
- The pipeline does not perform well on the chalenging videos, as discussed in the writeup document. 

### Where to find more information
- The notebook and file `writeup.md` provide more information on the processing pipeline
- OpenCV documentation and tutorials can be found on the [OpenCV website](https://opencv.org/)
- More information on the original assignment can be found in the original [github repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Vehicle-Detection)
